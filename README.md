#  Using Shark Tracking Data to Play Mario 

Using a dataset tracking shark movements, the program cleans and converts the data into controller movements to control Mario. Depth changes are converted into up/down movements. Longitude is converted into left/right movements.

The sharks are unfortunately not very good and have not managed to complete the first level yet. They just need more practice.
